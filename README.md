    <h1>Blog on my Second Degree Experience</h1>
      <p> My name is David Park and I am currently a Second Degree student studying Computer Science at Simon Fraser University  
      (SFU). My First degree was in a BSc in Cognitive Systems which was completed at the Univsersity of British Columbia (UBC).
      </p>
      <p>The purpose of this blog is to give some insight on my experiences at university with a focus on helping out future
      second degree students who are looking to study computer science at SFU. This blog can hopefully serve some reassurance
      that you are on the right track in terms of applications, due dates, course selections, waitlists, etc. However, if there 
      are some doubts it is always best to contact the services SFU provides. I will link those services down below under the 
      header "Resources"

<!--
a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:

<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to "#footer" and the text from "cat photos" to "Jump to Bottom".

Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.

Then add an id attribute with a value of "footer" to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page.
