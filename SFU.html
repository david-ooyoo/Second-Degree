    <h1>SFU (Second Degree)</h1>
    <hr /> 
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I will be talking about the courses I took each semester as well as some information regarding the application process as a second degree student. </p> 
    <br>

    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>
      SFU goes by a trimester system, meaning that school runs from Fall 20XX to Summer of the following year. Because of this, there are three chances for 
      a degree holder to apply to SFU. With that said, it is fine to take a lesser course load in the summer so you can work on personal projects/work/find co-op. 
      The following webpage: <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/students/deadlines/admission_scholarships.html">http://www.sfu.ca/students/deadlines/admission_scholarships.html</a>
      is constantly updated and should be referred to to see current deadlines for the upcoming semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should look into applying around the time applications open up (usually around October). Like most other schools, this gives you time to apply for scholarships, get
      considered for early acceptance, and have enough time to gather any supporting documents for the application. With SFU, you can apply for the Summer or Fall term 
      within the same deadline and the application opens at the same time as well. For example, the deadline for the Fall 2020 and Summer 2020 application was January 31st.
      <ul>
        Here are some helpful links to help you get started
        <li><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission/apply.html">Application Page</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission/apply/admission-averages.html">Admissions Average for the past Semester</a></li>
      </ul>
      Because you are a post-secondary student, you don't have to worry about self-reporting grades. After applying, you should refer to the <a href="Resources.html">Resources</a>
      page to waive any courses that you have completed in your first degree. One thing to note is to set any incoming SFU emails to be non-spam. My acceptance email was found in my 
      junk mail and I almost missed the deadline to accept my offer.

    <p>
      In general, any 100-level language course is an easy A as long as you are interested in learning the language. There are easy
      marks to obtain through the exercises given for the class and the weekly quizzes just test you on the vocab you learned from the 
      previous week.
