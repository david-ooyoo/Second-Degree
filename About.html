        <p>The purpose of this blog is to give some insight on my experiences at university with a focus on helping out future
        second degree students who are looking to study computer science at SFU. This blog can hopefully serve some reassurance
        that you are on the right track in terms of applications, due dates, course selections, waitlists, etc. However, if there 
        are some doubts it is always best to contact the services SFU provides. I will link those services within the section titled <a href="Resources">Resources</a>
