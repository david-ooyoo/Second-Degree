        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>This <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2019/summer/programs/computing-science-second-degree/major/bachelor-of-science-or-bachelor-of-arts.html">page</a> refers
        has general information about the number of credits required and the courses available to take. It also contains links to SFU Computing Science <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/admissions/advising.html">
        Advising </a></p>

        <h3>Degree Progress</h3>
        <p>
            This <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/computing/Undergraduate_students/forms/Fall2019/13.%20COMPUTING%20SCIENCE%20SECOND%20DEGREE%20FALL%202019%20-%20AB.pdf">PDF.</a> serves
            as a means to check your progress throughout your degree as well as keep track and plan your courses.
            I recommend printing or downloading it for your own reference. It is also important to note that these courses are not always available
            each semester so it would be best to plan out your schedule with an advisor. Core courses like CMPT 300/307/376 and MACM 316 are available every semester and I recommend to keep 
            one or two of those courses as a float in the case you cannot get into a course you want. Waitlists are one of the major problems SFU has when it comes to
            course enrollment.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Electives</h3>
        <p>You are also allowed 6 Upper Division Credits (equivalent to two courses) as a Second Degree Student. Here are a couple of links to help you decide on what to take.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/ugcr/for_students/Upper-Division_Breadth_Courses.html">SFU Upper Division Breadth Courses</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.sfu.ca/science/students/advising/UDsci.html">SFU Upper Division Science Courses</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            If you see any courses that have XX-number of credits needed to be taken as a pre-requisite, Second Degreee students
            meet that criteria and so you are able to register for those.
            </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>
           This <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/computing/current-students/undergraduate-students/forms.html">webpage</a>
           contains a lot of important forms regarding pre-requisites, appeals, planning, etc. The <b>"Prerequisite Waiver Form"</b> is very
           important because that is what you will use to transfer your credits from your first degree to your second. Make sure to download
           all your syllabi for any courses you've completed in your first degree because it is a requirement for the pre-requisite waiver form.
           You also need to provide a brief reason for why you want to waive the course.
       </p>

       <br>
       <h3>Course Registration</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, it is important to note: if you are transferring any credits (i.e. have successfully waived the courses you wanted) to satisfy 
            the lower division pre-requisite courses, make sure to email the appropriate advising office to avoid complications before your registration. 
            Second Degree students have a problem when it comes to course registration because SFU's system doesn't recognize the transferred courses as 
            credit taken at SFU.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>For <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/admissions/advising.html"> Computer Science Advising</a></li>
                <li>For <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/math/undergraduate/current-students/advising.html">Math Advising</a></li>
            </ul>
        <p>   
            For example: If you have waived MACM 101 (Discrete Mathematics I), and wanted to register for MACM 201, you would want to contact Math Advising because MACM 
            is under the Math Department. If you just let them know you are a second degree student, they will know what to do.
