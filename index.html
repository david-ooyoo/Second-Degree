        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> My name is David Park and I am currently a Second Degree student studying Computer Science at Simon Fraser University (SFU). My First degree was in a BSc in Cognitive Systems which was completed at the Univsersity of British Columbia (UBC).</p>
        <p>The purpose of this blog is to give some insight on my experiences at university with a focus on helping out future
      	second degree students who are looking to study computer science at SFU. This blog can hopefully serve some reassurance
      	that you are on the right track in terms of applications, due dates, course selections, waitlists, etc. However, if there 
      	are some doubts it is always best to contact the services SFU provides. I will link those services down below under the 
      	header "Resources"
